# NeurIPS19_VPtree_Dics
These are two dictionaries of the entities and relations in NeurIPS 2019 conference.

Both of the dictionaries include ``NULL'' and ``unknown'' categories. The former is set for meaningless nodes when matching the actual sentence. The latter is set to represent the low-frequency categories in the long-tail lists.
